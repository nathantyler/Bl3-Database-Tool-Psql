# Bl3-Database-Tool-Psql
A java swing app to help with the archiving of Borderlands 3 items to a database (currently postgres).

This app was started with the task of easily creating a database of Borderlands 3 items in mind.
The goal is to write insert queries to a .psql file to easily fill a table. This way the user doesn't have to type
all entries by hand. The goal is to automate as much as the process as possible so that there will be little to
no typing required.

Very early stages still (the window has been laid out and rendered, but it currently does nothing). More to come.
